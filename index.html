      <h1>QUALITY COFFEE, QUALITY CAFFEINE</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Bcaffee</strong> team welcomes you! A small cozy cafe with a practically homely atmosphere is located in the Southampton. Bcaffee is a few months of fruitful work by designers, architects and builders, bartenders and photographers. Today we are pleased to tell you about the results of our work and we hope that you will be able to appreciate them. The interior is made in the style of Provence. For painting the walls, paints of a golden and purple hue were used. On the walls are also decorative panels of wood of different varieties. Wooden furniture with antique elements and other interior details are custom-made by professional craftsmen. A harmonious combination of colors and materials gives a feeling of comfort and makes staying in our cafe incredibly comfortable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We care about each of our visitors, so we tried to take into account the taste preferences of each. The selection of drinks on the menu is quite impressive. A professional <em>coffee sommelier</em> has compiled a coffee list for us, so it contains only the highest quality coffees from around the world with a detailed description of each of them. 
      </p>
      <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
      <p>
        "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted
        in a damn good cup of coffee.  Bcaffe's CEO is that man, and you already know his 
        plan: a Bcaffe on every corner.
      </p> 
      <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today 
        you can enjoy Bcaffee just about anywhere.  And, of course, the big news this year 
        is that Bcaffe teamed up with Head First readers to create Bcaffe's Web presence,  
        which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of 
        customers.  
      </p>
      <h1>BCAFFEE HIGH QUALITY COFFEE</h1>
